# GraphQL API: Book Search Engine 

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This application is a Google Books API search engine that has been refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

The app was built using a RESTful API which has been replaced with an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. The existing authentication middleware has been modified so it works in the context of a GraphQL API. An Apollo Provider was created so that requests can communicate with the Apollo Server.
